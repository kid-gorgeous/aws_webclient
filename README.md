# Install

I have prepared this library with poetry, and created an install script that will help navigate the aws client.
<br>
First please use ```bash chmod +x install.sh```
<br>
Finally, using ```bash ./install.sh```

# AWS Client

This is a simple AWS client that I have prepared for my general use. I have intended to make this public, and throughout its lifecycle I will try to prepared public updates in the future.

If you like my code please feel free to star this repository, and provide feedback if any bugs arise!
